
# Fluid Framework Test Data repo

This repo contains large data file for testing for the main [FluidFramework](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework) repo.

The main repo [FluidFramework](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework) refers to this repo via submodules. This repo need not be cloned separately, but rather can be pulled into a local FluidFramework clone via `git submodule init` followed by `git submodule update`.  Doing so is optional to avoid downloading large files, but some of the tests will not run locally if the submodule isn't pull in.
