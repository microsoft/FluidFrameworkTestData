This repo contains large data file for testing for the main [FluidFramework](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework) repo.

The main repo [FluidFramework](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework) refers to this repo via submodules.

This repo need not be cloned separately, but rather can be pulled into a local FluidFramework clone via `git submodule init` followed by `git submodule update`. Doing so is optional to avoid downloading large files, but some of the tests will not run locally if the submodule isn't pulled in.

Make sure you have "git lfs" installed otherwise the snapshot files will not be pulled in correctly.
